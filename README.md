# Utensil-Dryer (In progress and iteration)
A custom dryer for utensils. 

The utensils are loaded in the middle of the utensil holder and the whole contraption is spun and then will force the water to the sides due to centripetal forces and eject the water off and result in the water falling into a container. That container can be emptied and cleaned later on.
